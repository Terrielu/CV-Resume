## About Me

I'm a DevOps Engineer with hands-on experience in:

- Linux administration and networking (OSPF, NAT, VPN, DNS, DHCP)
- Infrastructure as Code: Docker, Vagrant, Ansible, Terraform
- CI/CD pipelines using GitLab CI
- Monitoring with Prometheus, Grafana, and custom exporters
- Deploying microservice clusters and internal tooling

I’m currently looking for a full-time position where I can contribute, grow, and learn from real-world systems.
